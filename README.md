#Moqat3a
##Project Description
###Moqat3a is a web application that aims to provide users with information about companies that have business dealings with Israel and offer alternative options. The project seeks to promote awareness and support for ethical consumer choices by providing users with alternative companies that align with their values.
The main features of the Moqat3a project include:

    Company Database: The application maintains a database of companies that engage in business activities with Israel. The database includes information such as company name, description, contact details, and the nature of their involvement with Israel.
    Search and Filter: Users can search for specific companies or filter the companies based on various criteria, such as industry, location, or level of involvement with Israel.
    Alternative Suggestions: For each company listed in the database, Moqat3a provides alternative options that users can consider. These alternatives are companies that share similar products or services but do not have any business connections with Israel.
    User Contributions: The application allows users to contribute to the database by suggesting new companies, providing additional information, or reporting inaccuracies. This feature ensures that the database remains up-to-date and comprehensive.
    User-Friendly Interface: Moqat3a offers a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. Users can quickly find the information they need and explore alternative options effortlessly.
